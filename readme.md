# A anthill simulation

This project is a simulation of 3 anthills on a 25*20 map 

Every anthill will be spawned at the begin of the game with 3 commanders and 5 workers


By default workers gather resources spawned randomly on the map and represented as a yellow circle or variable radius . 

If the queen (ie anthill) send the order to go back to the anthill , the order will be send to every ant . Only officers who belongs to the sending anthill , officers will transmit the order to everyone and only then nearby workers who belong to the officer will go to the anthill
